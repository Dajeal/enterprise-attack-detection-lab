# Enterprise Attack Simulation & SIEM Detection Lab

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world cyber attack against a Windows 11 endpoint and demonstrates detection, investigation, and alert creation using Splunk SIEM.

The lab replicates common enterprise attack techniques including brute force authentication attempts and reverse shell execution, then walks through log ingestion, analysis, and incident response documentation.

### Objective

- Simulate attacker activity from Kali Linux
- Ingest Windows logs into Splunk
- Detect malicious behavior using log analysis
- Create automated detection alerts
- Produce a structured incident response report
- Map findings to MITRE ATT&CK framework
 

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Hydra for brute force RDP Attack
- Metasploit for reverse shell execction.
